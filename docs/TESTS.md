# Testing

This project strives to utilize unit tests wherever possible. These can help reduce the chance of unwanted bugs and errors.

## Svelte files

We are not currently utilizing unit tests for `.svelte` files. However, if you would like to, you are more than welcome to add some.

## TypeScript files

Files that export general-purpose (i.e., not used for one specific task) functions should have a corresponding `.test.ts` file. Import the modules and create your tests here.
